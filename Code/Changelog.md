Removed helpers, run_til_attractor, and cooperation_metrics, and WIP section as not relelvant to my part and were just a quick sketch not fit for purpose.
Added tit for tat.
Change default payoff to be the usual
NetworkSimulation now owns neighbor-index caching plus cooperation_neighbor_stats, and cooperation_assortment uses the cache.
