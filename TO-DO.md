- Tim

**RQ3**. As a control parameter (e.g., temptation $T $, ratio $b/c$, noise $K$, rewiring rate $w$) varies, is there a threshold at which the cooperative subgraph transitions from fragmented components to a giant cooperative component?

**Measurements**. Use $S_\text{max}(t)$ as an order parameter and define a percolation-style susceptibility from cooperative component counts. Let $n_s(t)$ be the number of cooperative components of size $s$ at time $t$. Then

$$\chi(t)=\frac{\sum_{s\neq s_\text{max} s^2n_s(t)}}{\sum_{s\neq s_\text{max} sn_s(t)}}.$$
Look for sharp changes in $\bar{S_\text{max}}$ and peaks in $\bar\chi$ across paramter sweeps.
