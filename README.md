# IPD on Networks (Skeleton)

This is a lightweight project skeleton for simulating the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma on a network using:

- `networkx` for graph generation
- `mesa` for agent-based modeling
- `axelrod` for PD strategies

The code is organized into small, modular components to help you expand as needed.
